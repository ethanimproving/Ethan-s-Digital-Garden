For audio files with no video, put a frequency visualization context an a video-sized canvas in a format similar toÂ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLRDqUfXeng>. Also make sure that you can click anywhere on the canvas to pause / play the video, and hovering over it will cause seek controls to show up, so that it gives the illusion of being a video.

Maybe have a graduation method where doctrines articulated ("created") by users can be adopted by a church, and work its way up to official categorization based on a certain number of churches adopting it. (Or a denomination adopting it.) There needs to be some organized interplay between doctrines that have already been pin pointed and categorized and then a user's ability to define doctrines that haven't. A list of affirmed doctrines, tweaked doctrines (affirmation with disclaimer note), and custom doctrines.

| Window # | Skill Level Progression                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1        | Very slow, lots of second-guessing. You‚Äôll likely need 4-6 hours, watch lots of YouTube, triple-check measurements, fight with shims, etc. Expect mistakes.                            |
| 2        | Still slow, but smoother. Now you‚Äôll know what tools you want nearby, how to handle the window safely, where you tend to make mistakes. Around 3-4 hours.                              |
| 3-4      | Confidence building. By now you‚Äôre starting to see ahead and know how things fit. Might be 2-3 hours per window depending on complexity.                                               |
| 5+       | Pretty efficient DIYer. Most average residential windows (say, 30x50 vinyl units) can be installed in about 1-2 hours if trim, leveling, and flashing go smoothly.<br><br><br><br><br> |

In brick veneer construction (which most homes have), your brick is not structural ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically a cladding sitting a few inches in front of your structural wall. The rough opening (wood framing) is behind the brick. **Your replacement window will fit into the existing framed rough opening, not the brick opening** (what you visually see from outside).

# Enlarging rough opening for retrofit window

[How to make a window bigger](https://youtu.be/SSHmoZR-r50?si=_HQ6B5_Xirzuq4OI)
## Option 1 (Most common DIY approach):¬†

Increase opening height slightly
- Carefully remove the interior sill stop at the bottom of the rough opening.
- Trim or notch ¬æ‚Äù out of the bottom framing member (sill plate or cripple stud).
- Ensure you stay fully above the rough framing plate (don‚Äôt compromise structure).
- Use flashing tape and sealant to fully waterproof the modified sill area.
- You now have the full 71.5‚Äù opening height.

üëâ This is very common with retrofits where you‚Äôre upgrading from old aluminum single-pane frames to deeper vinyl frames.

## Option 2:¬†
Order custom sizes (safer, more expensive)
- Home Depot, Lowe‚Äôs, and most window suppliers can special-order windows to exact measurements. This usually costs ~20‚Äì30% more per window and takes 3‚Äì6 weeks.
## Option 3 (possible but risky):¬†

Lower the head flashing inside the opening
- Instead of modifying the sill, you could adjust the top header trim or head stop.
- This depends on how your existing window was installed and your interior trim situation.

# Options

Currently I have 12 exterior windows and 2 interior windows that I will probably just get rid of. 4 of those windows are in the sunroom, which I am willing to do myself, leaving 8 windows for the professionals. All 14 of my windows are single pane aluminum windows. Power Home Remodeling said they want to upgrade them to vinyl windows. Upgrading offers the potential for better insulation and aesthetics.

## Low E Coating

| Feature                            | Double-Pane Windows                                            | Low-E Double-Pane Windows                                             |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Glass Layers                       | 2 layers of glass with an insulating gas (argon or krypton)    | 2 layers of glass with an insulating gas + Low-E coating              |
| U-Value (Insulation Rating)        | Typically between 0.30 - 0.50 (lower is better)                | Typically between 0.20 - 0.30 (improved insulation)                   |
| Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) | Around 0.30 - 0.40 (moderate heat blocking)                    | Around 0.25 - 0.30 (better at blocking heat from the sun)             |
| Energy Efficiency                  | Improved insulation compared to single-pane, reduces heat loss | Superior energy efficiency due to heat reflection + better insulation |
| UV Protection                      | Minimal UV protection                                          | Blocks up to 70% or more of UV rays, reducing fading of interiors     |
| Heating Efficiency (Winter)        | Prevents heat loss, keeps interiors warmer                     | Reflects heat back inside, further reducing heat loss                 |
| Cooling Efficiency (Summer)        | Reduces some heat transfer from outside                        | Reflects outdoor heat away, significantly lowering cooling costs      |
| Cost                               | Lower upfront cost, moderate energy savings                    | Higher upfront cost, greater long-term energy savings                 |


# Sales Pitch

## Lift Assist

## Department Of Energy

The Department Of Energy says you should be spending about 65-75 cents per square foot on energy each year.

## Fusion-welded vs. Mechanically Fastened Window Frames

[Welded Frames DON'T MATTER - Here's Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WAH8-CSrJE)

Fusion Welded frames are molecularly bonded rather than screwed together.

## Zen Glass (Triple Silver Coating)

- **Low-E Glass Coatings:** This glass has three microscopically thin layers of silver to reflect infrared radiation, helping to control heat transfer. This improves energy efficiency by keeping your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer. It also enhances UV protection, preventing furniture and floors from fading.
- **Argon Gas Fills:** These gas fills between the panes of glass act as an insulator to further reduce heat transfer.
- **Double Pane Options:** Thinner (3 mm) glass on the interior pane helps maintain transparency and reduces weight, while the thicker (5 mm) exterior glass improves durability and enhances protection against outside elements like wind and debris, making the window stronger.
- **UV Protection:** Some glass options are treated to block harmful UV rays, which helps protect furniture, carpets, and flooring from fading.

## Seal Failures

There are 3 stages of seal failures:
1. Moisture comes between the panes when the aluminum framing bends
2. Calcification
3. Mold

![](https://greatinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_20170622_085200-300x225.jpg)

## Insulation

Don't just caulk the window sills, but use a [OSI QUAD Window & Door Foam](https://www.homedepot.com/p/OSI-QUAD-Window-and-Door-16-fl-oz-Tan-Insulation-Foam-1927125/205761633) and or [OSI Quad Max](https://www.homedepot.com/p/OSI-QUAD-Max-9-5-fl-oz-Black-003-Exterior-Window-Door-and-Siding-Caulk-Sealant-2949532/329167517) to prevent air leaks.

## Heat Tests

How much of the sun's energy makes it through?

| Glass Type        | % Radiation Passthrough |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Single Pane       | 80                      |
| Double Pane       | 63                      |
| Triple Pane       | 50                      |
| Double Pane Low E | 58                      |
| Zen Glass         | 1                       |

### Key Components:

1. **Jambs**: The vertical sides of the window frame.
2. **Sill**: The bottom horizontal part of the window frame.
3. **Head**: The top horizontal part of the window frame.

It's also worth putting an insulation strip in the gaps of the window to make it more sound proof.

## Soft Pockets

## Stock vs. Custom

**Standard-sized windows** are pre-made and designed to fit standard rough openings in homes. These are often more affordable and readily available. On the other hand, **custom-sized windows** are made to fit specific measurements that don‚Äôt match the standard sizes, typically used for older homes or special architectural designs.

For a single individual the poverty line is $15,060. Multiplying by 200% means I need to make $30,120 or less to qualify. I make 4.6 times that amount, making me ineligible. |

# Trim attic stairs

# Cutting the feet to fit

## Before you begin:

The attic ladder should be properly shimmed and securely nailed to the frame in the proper location.

**WARNING:** Use of the attic ladder is not safe yet. Do not unfold the attic ladder yet. Do not step on the attic ladder nor leave it unattended until completely installed and both legs are adjusted to rest on the floor. This can damage the attic ladder and cause severe injury.

## STEP 1

Make sure that the lid is fully open. Unfold legs of the attic ladder and fold the bottom section as shown in Figure 26.

## STEP 2

Loosen screws as shown by arrow 1 and move the steps away from the lid as shown by arrow 2 (Figure 27).

## STEP 3

Tighten the previously loosened screws as shown by arrow 3 (Figure 28).

**WARNING:** Upon completion of these tasks, the distance between the steps and the lid should remain constant. Otherwise, this can cause damage to the attic ladder and cause severe injuries.

## STEP 4: Measuring

Using a [straight edge](https://www.homedepot.com/p/POWERTEC-50-in-Anodized-Aluminum-Straight-Edge-Ruler-Metal-Machined-Flat-to-Within-0-003-in-Over-Full-50-in-71503/313566829), measure the distance "A" and "B" as shown on Figure 26. This measurement should be very precise to ensure proper trimming of the legs.

**ATTENTION:** Measure the distance "A" and "B" on both sides of the attic ladder. The distance may not be the same on both sides of the attic ladder.

## STEP 5: Marking

Measure the "A" and "B" distance from the top edge of the bottom section of the attic ladder and mark it on both legs (Figure 29). Trim lines must be accurate to avoid trimming the legs too short.

**WARNING:** If the trimming line is marked along the rung, reposition the full run of steps where it is attached to the lid. The trimming line must not be in line with the rung (Figure 30). Next, repeat measurements "A" and "B" starting from step 4.

## STEP 6: Sawing

Trim the legs along the trimming lines. Trim the corners of the legs perpendicular to side "B" but no more than 1/2" from the corner (Figure 29). Using an attic ladder with too short legs will damage the ladder and can cause severe injuries.

## STEP 7

Check for proper trimming of the legs by unfolding the full run. The ladder should look like Figure 31. There should be no gaps between the metal hinges, and the feet should be flush with the floor.

**ATTENTION:** Gaps between the metal hinges mean that the feet are not properly trimmed (Figure 32 and 33). Do not climb the attic ladder if there are visible gaps between the metal hinges. This can cause damage to the attic ladder and result in serious injury. If the attic ladder looks like Figure 32, one or both legs are too long. Send or trim the feet until there are no gaps between the metal hinges, and both legs are flush with the floor. If the legs look like Figure 33, both legs are too short. If there are no gaps between the metal hinges but one leg is too short, use of the attic ladder is not safe. If the legs are trimmed too short, do not use the attic ladder. Contact your local dealer.

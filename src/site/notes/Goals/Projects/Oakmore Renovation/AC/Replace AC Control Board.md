The AC unit isn’t turning on when the thermostat is calling for cold air through the yellow wire. We tested the compressor was good, and the contractor is good. If we plug the yellow wire directly into the contactor, bypassing the control board, the unit turns on when the thermostat calls for air. So we thought it was a faulty control board and replaced it with another used one we bought on eBay. But then that control board isn’t sending 24 V to the contractor either so we are guessing the control board is stopping the signal due to some safety features like low refrigerant pressure or some such.

# Key Terms

## Thermostat

The thermostat is a device that regulates the temperature of a system to maintain the desired setpoint. It controls the AC unit by sending signals through various wires, including the yellow wire, which typically signals the cooling function.

## Yellow Wire

In the context of HVAC systems, the yellow wire is used to control the cooling system. When the thermostat calls for cooling, it sends a signal through the yellow wire to activate the compressor and other cooling components.

## AC Unit

The air conditioning unit, or AC unit, is a system used to cool and dehumidify indoor air. It consists of several components, including the compressor, evaporator coil, and condenser coil, which work together to remove heat from the indoor air and expel it outside.

## Compressor

The compressor is a crucial component of the AC unit that pumps refrigerant through the system. It compresses the refrigerant, increasing its pressure and temperature, which allows it to release heat as it moves through the condenser coils.

## Contactor

The contactor is an electrical relay that controls the power to the compressor and condenser fan motor. It receives a low-voltage signal from the thermostat (usually through the yellow wire) and closes the circuit to allow high-voltage power to reach the AC components.

## Control Board

The control board is the electronic brain of the AC unit. It manages the signals from the thermostat and ensures that all components of the AC system operate correctly. If the control board fails, it can prevent the system from functioning properly.

## Safety Features

Modern AC units have several safety features to protect the system from damage. These include sensors for low refrigerant pressure, high pressure, high temperature, and other conditions that could indicate a problem. These safety features can shut down the system to prevent damage.

## Troubleshooting Process

When diagnosing AC unit issues, a step-by-step troubleshooting process is followed:

- **Initial Symptoms**: The AC unit does not turn on when the thermostat calls for cooling.
- **Testing Components**: The compressor and contactor are tested and found to be working.
- **Direct Wiring Test**: The yellow wire is connected directly to the contactor, and the unit turns on, indicating the wiring and components are functional.
- **Control Board Replacement**: The control board is suspected to be faulty and is replaced, but the issue persists, suggesting that the control board may be stopping the signal due to safety features.

It was a pinhole leak in the reversing valve [capillary tubes](https://theengineeringmindset.com/reversing-valves/) that leaked all 11 pounds of my R22 Freon. Years of rubbing against another pipe caused the tube to wear down until there was a tiny hole created.

Since R22 is so expensive (~$300/pound), they donâ€™t make units for it anymore, which means I need to replace both my outside Central AC and inside Air Handler.

However I can get 15 pounds of R22 for $30\pound from [Ability Refrigerants](https://abilityrefrigerants.com/product/r22-refrigerant-15-lbs/) if I obtain an [[Money/House/Renovation Skills/HVAC/EPA 608 Type 2 Certification\|EPA 608 Type 2 certification]]. If I can patch the leak with [self-fusing silicone tape](https://a.co/d/0bL8ZVlI), it may give me some time for it to limp along. I need 11 pounds. Then I would just need to learn how to charge the system with the purchased Freon.

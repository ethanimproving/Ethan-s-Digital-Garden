# STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

## 1. Plan & Layout
- Use string lines and stakes to mark your slab footprint.
- Add 2” extra on all sides for easier installation.
- Verify it’s square using 3-4-5 triangle method.

## 2. Excavation
- Excavate 6” below final grade: 
  - 2-3” for gravel base
  - 4” for concrete slab
    
- Make sure you get a flat, even bottom.
- Remove any roots, organic material, or loose soil.

## 3. Compact Subgrade
- Use tamper or plate compactor.
- Add 2-3” of gravel.
- Compact gravel thoroughly.

## 4. Build Form
- Build perimeter forms with 2x4 or 2x6.
- Drive stakes every 2-3 feet for support.
- Use level to ensure forms are perfectly level all around.
- Apply form oil or cooking spray to inside of forms.

## 5. Set Rebar
- Cut rebar to size.
- Make a grid ~18”-24” apart.
- Use rebar chairs or bricks to elevate grid ~1.5” into slab.
- Tie intersections with rebar tie wire.

## 6. Pour Concrete
- Mix concrete in batches if DIY, or schedule delivery.
- Place concrete into forms, work into corners.
- Use shovel or rake to spread and roughly level.

## 7. Screed the Surface
- Use a long straight 2x4 to screed across the top of the forms.
- Move slowly back and forth while advancing.

## 8. Finish Surface
- Use float to smooth out surface.
- Wait for bleed water to dissipate.
- Use trowel for smooth finish (or broom finish if you prefer slip resistance).
- Edge with concrete edging tool for clean edges.

## 9. Cure the Concrete
- Cover with plastic sheet or spray with curing compound.
- Keep moist for 2-3 days.
- Full cure takes ~28 days but it’s usable for light weight (like your shed) after ~3-5 days.

## 10. Remove Forms
- Remove forms after 24-48 hours.

⚠️ PRO TIPS
- Don’t work on extremely hot or windy days if you can avoid it.
- Have extra help on pour day — concrete works fast.
- Watch lots of YouTube videos on:  
    “DIY concrete slab for shed”  
    “Pouring small concrete pad with rebar”  
    “Screeding and finishing small concrete slab”

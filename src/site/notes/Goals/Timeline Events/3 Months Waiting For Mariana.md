Mariana said she wanted 3 months talk to herself and figure out where she wants to go in this relationship. She always says she wants to get married, but she's not ready yet. She asked me not to propose to her last year, and again this year. After [[Relationship/Diary/Open Relationship\|having a talk]] at the Arboretum, we agreed to wait 3 months until deciding anything. At the end of that 3 months, I will begin dating other girls if she is not mentally ready to move our relationship forward.

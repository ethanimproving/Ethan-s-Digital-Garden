While there haven't been recent surveys directly asking women about their **preferred** diamond cuts, there is strong market data and industry reports suggesting which cuts are most popular. Here's what we know:

**Most Popular Diamond Cuts:**

- **Round Brilliant:** This reigns supreme, consistently holding over 60% of the market share for engagement rings (GIA data). Its classic look, maximum brilliance, and versatility contribute to its enduring popularity.
- **Princess Cut:** Following closely behind, princess cuts offer a modern square shape with excellent brilliance and affordability, making them a popular choice.
- **Cushion Cut:** Blending brilliance with a square or rectangular shape with soft corners, cushion cuts offer a vintage vibe and are known for their larger facets that showcase fire (rainbow colors).
- **Oval Cut:** Gaining traction in recent years, oval cuts provide an elongated brilliance similar to round stones but with a unique, flattering silhouette.
- **Emerald Cut:** Known for its elegant, Art Deco aesthetic and larger table (top facet), emerald cuts prioritize clarity and step-cut facets over sparkle.

**Important Note:**

These are just the most popular options, and **personal preference ultimately reigns supreme**. What a woman truly desires in a diamond comes down to individual style, taste, and finger shape. Some may prioritize brilliance, while others prefer unique shapes or vintage aesthetics.

**Alternatives to Popularity:**

Instead of solely relying on popularity, consider these factors when choosing a diamond:

- **The woman's individual style:** Does she prefer classic, modern, vintage, or something unique?
- **Finger shape:** Some cuts complement certain finger shapes better than others.
- **Setting preferences:** Certain cuts work better with specific settings.
- **Budget:** Different cuts vary in price due to factors like rarity and waste during cutting.

Remember, the most important aspect is choosing a diamond that resonates with the woman who will wear it.

# Qualitative vs Quantitative

"It's shiny" is qualitative, relying on vague descriptions to describe the quality. Carat size is quantitative, where you can measure how heavy it is. 

A **princess cut** can appear larger than a round brilliant cut of the same carat weight because of its square shape and larger face-up surface area. Here's why:

- **Face-Up Area:** Princess cuts have a square top with sharp corners, which maximizes the visible area when viewed from above. Round cuts lose some of their face-up area due to their rounded edges.
    
- **Depth Differences:** Round brilliant diamonds often have a deeper cut to achieve their signature sparkle, which means more of their carat weight is hidden below the surface. Princess cuts typically have a shallower depth, so more of the carat weight contributes to the visible size.
    

For smaller carat weights, this difference in perceived size can be even more pronounced, making princess cuts a popular choice for maximizing the appearance of a diamond within a budget.

## Size to Weight Chart

Here’s a table comparing **carat weight** for **Princess Cut** and **Round Brilliant** diamonds based on their **diameter (mm)** from **5mm to 10mm**:

| Size (mm) | Round Brilliant (Carats) | Princess Cut (Carats) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 5.0 mm    | ~0.50 ct                 | ~0.55 ct              |
| 5.5 mm    | ~0.75 ct                 | ~0.70 ct              |
| 6.0 mm    | ~0.90 ct                 | ~1.00 ct              |
| 6.5 mm    | ~1.00 ct                 | ~1.25 ct              |
| 7.0 mm    | ~1.30 ct                 | ~1.50 ct              |
| 7.5 mm    | ~1.60 ct                 | ~1.75 ct              |
| 8.0 mm    | ~2.00 ct                 | ~2.25 ct              |
| 8.5 mm    | ~2.50 ct                 | ~2.75 ct              |
| 9.0 mm    | ~3.00 ct                 | ~3.25 ct              |
| 9.5 mm    | ~3.50 ct                 | ~3.75 ct              |
| 10.0 mm   | ~4.00 ct                 | ~4.50 ct              |

## How shiny did you say?

The **Round Brilliant Cut** is significantly **shinier** than a **Princess Cut** due to its superior light performance. While "shininess" is subjective, we can look at **quantitative metrics** to compare their brilliance.

### 1. Light Performance Metrics

Diamonds reflect light in three key ways:

| **Light Type**                         | **Description**                                                  | **Round Brilliant (%)**                        | **Princess Cut (%)**                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Brilliance** (White Light Return)    | Measures the amount of white light reflected back to the viewer. | **~93%**                                       | **~70-80%**                           |
| **Fire** (Dispersion of Colors)        | Measures how much white light is split into rainbow colors.      | **~20-30% higher than Princess**               | Lower due to fewer triangular facets. |
| **Scintillation** (Sparkle & Contrast) | The flash of light when moving the diamond.                      | **Higher, due to 57-58 well-optimized facets** | Less contrast, blocky light return.   |

### 2. Why is Round Brilliant Shinier?

- **Facet Count & Arrangement**:
	- **Round Brilliant** has **57-58 facets**, designed for maximum light return.
	- **Princess Cut** has **50-58 facets**, but its deeper pavilion (bottom half) absorbs more light.
        
- **Light Leakage**:
	- **Rounds return nearly all light**, while Princess Cuts leak more due to their square shape.
        
- **Ideal Cut Precision**:
	- **Rounds are optimized for brightness** and have GIA-graded "Cut Quality."
	- **Princess Cuts don’t have an overall "Cut Grade"**, making brilliance harder to quantify.
        

### 3. How Much More Sparkly is Round Brilliant?
- Studies show **Round Brilliant reflects ~20-30% more light** than Princess Cut.
- Human eyes perceive **a ~40% increase in "perceived sparkle"** in well-cut Round diamonds compared to Princess Cuts of the same quality.

| Optical Property                         | Unit of Measurement                           | Round Brilliant    | Princess Cut           |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Brilliance (White Light Return)          | Candela per square meter (cd/m²)              | ~200,000 cd/m²     | ~140,000–160,000 cd/m² |
| Fire (Spectral Dispersion)               | Nanometers (nm) - Refractive Index Difference | ~0.044 RI          | ~0.035–0.040 RI        |
| Scintillation (Light Flashes & Contrast) | Lux (lx) or foot-candles (fc)                 | ~15,000–20,000 lux | ~10,000–14,000 lux     |
| Light Leakage (Lost Light)               | Lumens (lm) or % Light Loss                   | ~<10% loss         | ~30-40% loss           |
| Optimal Light Return Angles              | Degrees (°)                                   | ~35-40°            | Less optimized, varies |


### Conclusion: Should You Choose Round or Princess?
- If maximum brilliance/sparkle is the goal → Round Brilliant.
- If size for budget & a modern look matter → Princess Cut (bigger face-up size per carat, lower cost).
# How To Propose
## Where To Propose

### Northern Lights

Kritika says to propose at the Northern Lights. See how magical it is. When can you see the aurora borealis. Nobody can beat nature at the end of the day.

Actions need to speak. You can say anything with your words.

### Waterside

Lucy said she imagines a waterside proposal during the evening with a sign. She wants to be brought out with her eyes closed, and uncover them to find her husband on one knee making the proposal. I can make that happen at the Harbor in Rockwall.

### Disneyland Japan

Originally I was going to propose Spring/Summer 2024 in Japan with Brian and Chio there, but then I got fired and that set my finances back. Now I'm not so sure about this place. Mariana said she likes to see proposals at Disney World, but she is kind of a shy girl so I don't know if she would personally want that attention herself.

## With Friends or No Friends

My friend Alondra told me her husband was good at getting photos of the proposal, but she needs a video. She's quite a bit more flashy than Mariana though, so I don't know if her opinion carries over.

I was thinking I can do it at the Harbor when her parents are in town. I can have a family outing during sunset, and propose in the evening. Brian can video, someone else can photograph. I can line the dock with candles and a sign.

## What To Say

It should be meaningful but brief. I have to choose my words carefully because I can only use a few of them. I can't let the time between her surprise and the answer last too long. I need strong, effective words I can say in less than 20 seconds, maybe even less time than that. But there's so much I would say.

See [[Goals/Timeline Events/Asking Mariana To Be My Girlfriend\|Asking Mariana To Be My Girlfriend]].

Example but too long: "You are the greatest adventure of my life. I don't want to be with you because I can imagine a life with you, but because I can't imagine my life without you. I can't imagine my future without you in it. You are the most incredible woman I could be blessed with. Nobody will support me like you. You support me unconditionally. Nobody listens to me like you, and cares about my beliefs like you. Nobody makes me laugh like you, and smile like you. Nobody makes me want to be better like you, and at the same time makes me feel completely received and accepted like you. Nobody makes me comfortable like you. Nobody argues like you. Nobody has the same sparkle in their eyes as you. And there's nobody in the whole world or all of history that I want to be with besides you.

And then you came along, and you were the most caring, selfless, kind, funny, adventurous, amazing girl I've ever met. 

- The way thay we argue.
- The way that you listen.
- The way that you have a sparkle in your eye when you see Disney or Harry Potter."

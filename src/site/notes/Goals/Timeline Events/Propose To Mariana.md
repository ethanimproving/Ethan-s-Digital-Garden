**Center Stone Categories**:

- **Earth-mined** Diamonds are diamonds formed and mined from the earth. These diamonds are the most expensive and we mainly purchase GIA Certified diamonds to ensure the best quality.  
    
- **Lab-grown** Diamonds are also 100% actual diamonds! They have the same carbon DNA make up as earth mined diamonds. It is impossible to distinguish between earth mined and a lab-grown diamond without doing lab testing.  Even professionals can't tell the difference. These are more budget and eco friendly.  
    
- **Diamond Simulants** are not diamonds but are stones that look like diamonds. For exp: Moissanite, White Sapphires, and Cubic Zirconia. To the untrained eye, it is hard to tell the difference between a diamond simulant and earth mined diamond and they too are budget-friendly. 
    

**Center Stone Criteria & Certification**:

- GIA (Gemology Institute of America) is one of the most respected certifications you can get for Earth Mined Diamonds. Each stone is graded by multiple experts ensuring each Diamond has an accurate quality grade.
    
- IGI (International Gemology Institute) is one of the most respected certifications you can get for Lab-Grown Diamonds. 
    

**Diamond 4C’s (Quality Characteristics)**

1. **Carat**: This is what determines the weight and size of the diamond.  The weight of a diamond has a significant role in the diamond's cost.
    

2. **Cut**: This is the most important characteristic when it comes to the sparkle of the diamond.  The better the cut the more light will go into the diamond and then reflect out, causing the diamond to "sparkle"!
    

Our Standard: Very Good or Excellent 

3. **Color**: This has to do with the absence of color in a Diamond or degree of colorlessness. The grading is alphabetical from D down to Z. The farther down the scale the more of a yellow to brown tint you will see.
    

Our Standard: I or better 

4. **Clarity**: This has to do with inclusions or blemishes in a Diamond. This is often the least important out of the 4C’s because the only way to see any imperfections is to put it under a microscope at the power 10 magnification. The main focus is whether a diamond is “eye clean” or not. 
    

Our Standard: SI2 or better

While there haven't been recent surveys directly asking women about their **preferred** diamond cuts, there is strong market data and industry reports suggesting which cuts are most popular. Here's what we know:

**Most Popular Diamond Cuts:**

- **Round Brilliant:** This reigns supreme, consistently holding over 60% of the market share for engagement rings (GIA data). Its classic look, maximum brilliance, and versatility contribute to its enduring popularity.
- **Princess Cut:** Following closely behind, princess cuts offer a modern square shape with excellent brilliance and affordability, making them a popular choice.
- **Cushion Cut:** Blending brilliance with a square or rectangular shape with soft corners, cushion cuts offer a vintage vibe and are known for their larger facets that showcase fire (rainbow colors).
- **Oval Cut:** Gaining traction in recent years, oval cuts provide an elongated brilliance similar to round stones but with a unique, flattering silhouette.
- **Emerald Cut:** Known for its elegant, Art Deco aesthetic and larger table (top facet), emerald cuts prioritize clarity and step-cut facets over sparkle.

**Important Note:**

These are just the most popular options, and **personal preference ultimately reigns supreme**. What a woman truly desires in a diamond comes down to individual style, taste, and finger shape. Some may prioritize brilliance, while others prefer unique shapes or vintage aesthetics.

**Alternatives to Popularity:**

Instead of solely relying on popularity, consider these factors when choosing a diamond:

- **The woman's individual style:** Does she prefer classic, modern, vintage, or something unique?
- **Finger shape:** Some cuts complement certain finger shapes better than others.
- **Setting preferences:** Certain cuts work better with specific settings.
- **Budget:** Different cuts vary in price due to factors like rarity and waste during cutting.

Remember, the most important aspect is choosing a diamond that resonates with the woman who will wear it.

# Qualitative vs Quantitative

"It's shiny" is qualitative, relying on vague descriptions to describe the quality. Carat size is quantitative, where you can measure how heavy it is. 

A **princess cut** can appear larger than a round brilliant cut of the same carat weight because of its square shape and larger face-up surface area. Here's why:

- **Face-Up Area:** Princess cuts have a square top with sharp corners, which maximizes the visible area when viewed from above. Round cuts lose some of their face-up area due to their rounded edges.
    
- **Depth Differences:** Round brilliant diamonds often have a deeper cut to achieve their signature sparkle, which means more of their carat weight is hidden below the surface. Princess cuts typically have a shallower depth, so more of the carat weight contributes to the visible size.
    

For smaller carat weights, this difference in perceived size can be even more pronounced, making princess cuts a popular choice for maximizing the appearance of a diamond within a budget.

## Size to Weight Chart

Here’s a table comparing **carat weight** for **Princess Cut** and **Round Brilliant** diamonds based on their **diameter (mm)** from **5mm to 10mm**:

| Size (mm) | Round Brilliant (Carats) | Princess Cut (Carats) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 5.0 mm    | ~0.50 ct                 | ~0.55 ct              |
| 5.5 mm    | ~0.75 ct                 | ~0.70 ct              |
| 6.0 mm    | ~0.90 ct                 | ~1.00 ct              |
| 6.5 mm    | ~1.00 ct                 | ~1.25 ct              |
| 7.0 mm    | ~1.30 ct                 | ~1.50 ct              |
| 7.5 mm    | ~1.60 ct                 | ~1.75 ct              |
| 8.0 mm    | ~2.00 ct                 | ~2.25 ct              |
| 8.5 mm    | ~2.50 ct                 | ~2.75 ct              |
| 9.0 mm    | ~3.00 ct                 | ~3.25 ct              |
| 9.5 mm    | ~3.50 ct                 | ~3.75 ct              |
| 10.0 mm   | ~4.00 ct                 | ~4.50 ct              |

## How shiny did you say?

The **Round Brilliant Cut** is significantly **shinier** than a **Princess Cut** due to its superior light performance. While "shininess" is subjective, we can look at **quantitative metrics** to compare their brilliance.

### 1. Light Performance Metrics

Diamonds reflect light in three key ways:

| **Light Type**                         | **Description**                                                  | **Round Brilliant (%)**                        | **Princess Cut (%)**                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Brilliance** (White Light Return)    | Measures the amount of white light reflected back to the viewer. | **~93%**                                       | **~70-80%**                           |
| **Fire** (Dispersion of Colors)        | Measures how much white light is split into rainbow colors.      | **~20-30% higher than Princess**               | Lower due to fewer triangular facets. |
| **Scintillation** (Sparkle & Contrast) | The flash of light when moving the diamond.                      | **Higher, due to 57-58 well-optimized facets** | Less contrast, blocky light return.   |

### 2. Why is Round Brilliant Shinier?

- **Facet Count & Arrangement**:
	- **Round Brilliant** has **57-58 facets**, designed for maximum light return.
	- **Princess Cut** has **50-58 facets**, but its deeper pavilion (bottom half) absorbs more light.
        
- **Light Leakage**:
	- **Rounds return nearly all light**, while Princess Cuts leak more due to their square shape.
        
- **Ideal Cut Precision**:
	- **Rounds are optimized for brightness** and have GIA-graded "Cut Quality."
	- **Princess Cuts don’t have an overall "Cut Grade"**, making brilliance harder to quantify.
        

### 3. How Much More Sparkly is Round Brilliant?
- Studies show **Round Brilliant reflects ~20-30% more light** than Princess Cut.
- Human eyes perceive **a ~40% increase in "perceived sparkle"** in well-cut Round diamonds compared to Princess Cuts of the same quality.

| Optical Property                         | Unit of Measurement                           | Round Brilliant    | Princess Cut           |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Brilliance (White Light Return)          | Candela per square meter (cd/m²)              | ~200,000 cd/m²     | ~140,000–160,000 cd/m² |
| Fire (Spectral Dispersion)               | Nanometers (nm) - Refractive Index Difference | ~0.044 RI          | ~0.035–0.040 RI        |

### Dallas Arboretum
#### 💐 Step 1: Pick the Spot

##### **Crape Myrtle Allee**

For Elegance. 

##### **Lay Family Garden**

For sunset over White Rock Lake.


#### 📸 Step 2: Set the Scene

- Have your brother or Alex stationed discreetly with a camera and gimbal
    
- Set up _one_ visual element: a bouquet, a small picnic blanket, a framed photo — enough to feel _intentional_, but still natural

##### Option 1: Private Walk, Friends Hidden Until After the Proposal

**✅ Pros:**

- She gets a _pure, intimate moment_ with just you.
    > That’s what she’ll replay in her mind forever.
- She can cry, hug you, react naturally without pressure.
- It builds suspense — and then surprise _again_ when the friends/family appear.
- Friends can still film discreetly without being “in the scene.”

**🚫 Cons:**

- If you don’t plan it well, she might wonder, “Why aren’t they here?”
- You need to manage coordination carefully so the reveal is smooth.

**Verdict:**  
✅ **This is almost always the better choice.**  
Let the moment be about _you and her_ — then bring in the joy, cheering, and celebration _after_ the ring is on her hand. It’s a one-two punch emotionally:

1. _Private intimacy_
2. _Public joy_

---

##### Option 2: Everyone Present From the Start

**✅ Pros:**

- Instant celebration. People cheering. Energy is high.
- Great if she’s very extroverted or thrives on shared experiences.

**🚫 Cons:**

- Can feel like a _performance_ instead of a moment.
- She might hold back tears or emotion if she’s self-conscious.
- Reactions can get diluted — “Oh wow!” instead of “_Oh my gosh this is happening_...”

**Verdict:**  
⚠️ Only do this if you know she _wants_ a group proposal and doesn’t mind being in the spotlight.

---

##### Hybrid Idea (Best of Both Worlds)

1. You walk her through the Arboretum to “take photos.”
2. Your friend (or brother) films from a hidden distance.
3. You propose somewhere beautiful and quiet.
4. After she says yes, you walk together to another spot — and _then_ your friends/family pop out with flowers, hugs, music, whatever.
    

This way, she gets the **emotional intimacy** of a private proposal _and_ the **excitement of celebrating with loved ones** minutes later.

#### 💄 Step 3: Get Her Camera-Ready Without Spoiling the Surprise

Use the cover story: “Let’s take cute couple photos with the garden flowers before the heat gets crazy.”
Or: “Alex wants to practice his photography — come with me for a shoot this weekend.”

#### ❤️ Step 4: Personalize the Moment

- Write her a **1-minute letter** or mini-speech to read or say before you kneel
- Include one sentence about why you didn’t wait for a trip or a party:
    > “I didn’t want to wait for the perfect vacation. I already had everything I needed right here — you.”


### The Harbour at Rockwall

### Disneyland

### Northern Lights

Kritika says to propose at the Northern Lights. See how magical it is. When can you see the aurora borealis. Nobody can beat nature at the end of the day.

Actions need to speak. You can say anything with your words.

### Waterside

Lucy said she imagines a waterside proposal during the evening with a sign. She wants to be brought out with her eyes closed, and uncover them to find her husband on one knee making the proposal. I can make that happen at the Harbor in Rockwall.

### Disneyland Japan

Originally I was going to propose Spring/Summer 2024 in Japan with Brian and Chio there, but then I got fired and that set my finances back. Now I'm not so sure about this place. Mariana said she likes to see proposals at Disney World, but she is kind of a shy girl so I don't know if she would personally want that attention herself.

### Poza Rica

### Bridgewater Amenities

### AT&T Discovery District

## With Friends or No Friends

My friend Alondra told me her husband was good at getting photos of the proposal, but she needs a video. She's quite a bit more flashy than Mariana though, so I don't know if her opinion carries over.

I was thinking I can do it at the Harbor when her parents are in town. I can have a family outing during sunset, and propose in the evening. Brian can video, someone else can photograph. I can line the dock with candles and a sign.

## What To Say

It should be meaningful but brief. I have to choose my words carefully because I can only use a few of them. I can't let the time between her surprise and the answer last too long. I need strong, effective words I can say in less than 20 seconds, maybe even less time than that. But there's so much I would say.

See [[Goals/Timeline Events/Asking Mariana To Be My Girlfriend\|Asking Mariana To Be My Girlfriend]].

Example but too long: "You are the greatest adventure of my life. I don't want to be with you because I can imagine a life with you, but because I can't imagine my life without you. I can't imagine my future without you in it. You are the most incredible woman I could be blessed with. Nobody will support me like you. You support me unconditionally. Nobody listens to me like you, and cares about my beliefs like you. Nobody makes me laugh like you, and smile like you. Nobody makes me want to be better like you, and at the same time makes me feel completely received and accepted like you. Nobody makes me comfortable like you. Nobody argues like you. Nobody has the same sparkle in their eyes as you. And there's nobody in the whole world or all of history that I want to be with besides you.

And then you came along, and you were the most caring, selfless, kind, funny, adventurous, amazing girl I've ever met. 

- The way thay we argue.
- The way that you listen.
- The way that you have a sparkle in your eye when you see Disney or Harry Potter."

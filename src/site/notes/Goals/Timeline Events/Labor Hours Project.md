This was a project where I tried to quantitatively evaluate the value of labor hours based not on market pay, but production value. I tried making a formula like the Black Scholes model for understanding the value of option derivatives in the stock market. It was an extremely interesting project, but I didn't have the time to bring it to fruition. It remains unfinished in my Resource Library under the "Wisdom" folder.

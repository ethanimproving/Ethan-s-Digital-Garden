# Apr 10 - 15

I worked on [Obsidian Timelines](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines/compare/main...ethanimproving:obsidian-timelines:main) as an alternative to the [Preceden app](https://www.preceden.com/). 

# May 2 - 3

The last plugin I created was [Cooklang](https://github.com/cooklang/cooklang-obsidian/compare/main...ethanimproving:cooklang-obsidian:main) before I stopped pursuing this skill.

# Timeline Idea

Download the Standalone [Timeglider GitHub repository](https://github.com/tkuhn/timeglider) and serve it with VS Code Live Server. Ask ChatGPT if it can write an Obsidian Plugin to incorporate Timeglider as it's own file, like Excellidraw does. In the meantime, simply add it to the digital garden client repository. There can be multiple files: History, Plans, Alternative Plans. You can go back and look at all the timelines that you imagined that never came to fruition. Like marrying Amy, or interning for a coding position. That way it's not conflated with what actually happened, but you can still live intentionally and make plans for your life.

Another idea is to render a dataview table from individual notes, and compile that table into a timeline. Look at `table.html` in the repo.

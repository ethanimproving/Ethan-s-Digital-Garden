Why do I cry? Why do I weep? Life is better than in the days of my happiest joy. I weep not for lack of bread, or of sickness, but for covetousness. My desire has increased over what I have. I seek Mariana. I seek all the things that would make her praise me. Money, fitness, travel, personality, comeliness. Why do I let myself be covetous for one person? She will not motivate me to listen to Piper, or slow down and address my emotions. She cares about me, but she doesn't have the spiritual remedies. She will tell me to play with my sister.

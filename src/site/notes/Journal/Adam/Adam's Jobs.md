Adam has charisma and has always been logical. His earning potential is very high, but he has never had the structure in his life to tap into it. I want to help accelerate his path to reaching a higher salary from a skill-based job. To do this, he needs to spend some time thinking about what kind of job he wants to train for. 

A good resource for this is the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/how-to-find-a-job/home.htm). Use their [Job Finder](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/occupation-finder.htm) to filter and sort by salary, projected growth in your area, required education, and more. I think he would be good at a sales kind of job, because of his natural skills with people.

The list goes on an on and on. And once you have the fields you're interested in or curious about, ask ChatGPT to generate a table predicting the IQ necessary to do that job. Take an IQ test and filter based on that. (Say you're 20 in the IQ test though. IQ is mental age / actual age). This step isn't completely necessity, but I think it is useful. IQ is just how fast you ascertain patterns. Low IQ doesn't mean you're incapable of doing a job. It means you would be slower under high pressure events. The Power of Will is more important, because ANY thought patterns are trainable if somebody wants to train for it.

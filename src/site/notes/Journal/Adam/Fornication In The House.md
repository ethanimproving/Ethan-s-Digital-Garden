Look, obviously you want to smash her. I have no personal feelings about that disrespecting the house, like, “Oh no, now the spirit of fornication is here. My walls are tainted with mystical sin dust.” BUT I don’t want God mad at me for enabling you to commit fornication without a proper warning that God WILL punish us for it.

So, first things first, the Bible teaches fornication is (1) in the top 6 most serious sins that people should get kicked out of church for, (2) God killed 23,000 people in one day because of it, and (3) besides being a sin, it’s also intrinsically foolish because women flatter you like you’re special but their open legs are a trap.

> 20. And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
> 21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
> 22. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
> 23. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 6:24-26 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+6:24-26&version=kjv)
> 24. To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
> 25. Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
> 26. For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.

> [!bible] [Proverbs 7:22-26 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+7:22-26&version=kjv)
> 22. He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
> 23. Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
> 24. Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
> 25. Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
> 26. For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 6:13-20 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6:13-20&version=kjv)
> 13. Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
> 14. And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
> 15. Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
> 16. What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
> 17. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
> 18. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
> 19. What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
> 20. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 10:8 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10:8&version=kjv)

> 3. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 5:9-13 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+5:9-13&version=kjv)
> 9. I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
> 10. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
> 11. But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
> 12. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
> 13. But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

So as someone who CARES about your well being, my recommendation is DO NOT DO IT. But if you do it, PLEASE do not tell me, because I’m technically under pressure to have nothing to do with you, so that (1) it doesn’t spread to others in the church, and (2) as part of the punishment for fornication we’re instructed to put you away from among ourselves.

I’m not personally mad at you if you do it, I understand, and I’m guilty of things worthy of getting kicked out of church too. Pastor Shelley gave me a lot of grace with a warning that if he hears about it again within a month he would have to exercise church discipline. But it turns out even if you escape the pastor, escaping God is another story. Unfortunately for us, he knows our heart and we cannot hide our intentions from him. I’m pretty sure I lost my job due to his chastisement.

So fair warning, if you end up getting freaky with her, there is a high chance God is going to punish you. And since you don’t have much to lose, remember you still have your HEALTH.

> [!bible] [Hebrews 12:5-11 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12:5-11&version=kjv)
> 5. And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
> 6. For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
> 7. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
> 8. But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
> 9. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,  and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
> 10. For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
> 11. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

> [!bible] [Hebrews 12:16 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12:16&version=kjv)
> 16. Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

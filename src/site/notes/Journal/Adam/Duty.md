# Come To Church

God has commanded certain things of us, and as men we have a duty. The Bible says the whole duty of man is to fear God and keep his commandments. So when we have a commandment of God not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, that means it’s our responsibility to be in church every first day to commemorate the resurrection and spur each other on.

# Make A Plan

What is your plan after Walmart? One of the things I want to do is help accelerate your path towards becoming independent.

# Don't Play XBOX

I gave you some time to grieve. Now that you’re moved on, grieving time is over. You don’t need to be playing XBOX. That’s a waste of time. Your social needs can be met at church. Your waking hours need to be on something productive to get out of your situation.

# Stop Being Anxious

You don’t need a haircut. You need is to get over your anxiety of presenting yourself to people. Depression is when you’re worried about the past, anxiety is when you’re worried about the future, and happiness is when you’re living in the moment. Get out of other people’s head. Seriously.

# Make An Appearance

When I come into this house, I expect you to make an appearance. It shows respect for the person who’s taking you in. If you estrange yourself from the person taking care you in, you’re limited your time there. The Bible says you’ll shall rise in the presence of the board head. Why? Because it shows respect when you acknowledge somebody’s appearance into the room. That will go a long way.

When I come into the house on Sundays, I have John with me. And I am going to expect you to come out and greet us, and say hi to John. A quick conversation. This is going to train you to start acknowledging people when they come in. It’s good etiquette. Because when I come into a house, and you stay in your room, you are saying, “You are less important than what I am doing with my time right now.” And when you don’t have a job, you don’t have anything important going on. Which means we are pretty unimportant to you. Change that habit.

Even if you go back to what you were doing, just getting up to say hi makes a big difference. Every time that I’m walking by my mom when she’s on her computer, I say “Hi mom.” That small act changes the entire dynamic. It’s also a way of saying, “I’m available if you need me.” I learned 4 lessons from a great man.

## Psychological Implications

This passage reflects several psychological and social dynamics:

1. **Respect and Acknowledgment**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of respect and acknowledgment in social interactions. By encouraging Adam to come out and greet people, the speaker is trying to instill a sense of social etiquette and respect for others. This reflects a broader societal norm where acknowledging someone's presence is a sign of respect and recognition.
2. **Social Training**: The speaker views this practice as a form of social training. By consistently engaging in these small social interactions, Adam can start to develop better social habits and become more comfortable in social situations. This gradual exposure can help reduce social anxiety and build social skills.
3. **Sense of Belonging and Connection**: The expectation to greet and interact with others can help Adam feel more connected to the people around him. This can counter feelings of isolation and help build a sense of community and belonging.
4. **Perceived Importance**: The speaker addresses the perception of importance. By staying in his room, Adam might unintentionally convey that the people entering the house are less important than whatever he is doing. Changing this habit can help shift how he values social interactions and relationships.
5. **Accountability and Responsibility**: The speaker is trying to instill a sense of accountability and responsibility in Adam. By setting clear expectations for social behavior, the speaker is encouraging Adam to take responsibility for his actions and their impact on others.

In terms of psychological implications, the speaker's approach can help Adam in several ways:

- **Building Social Confidence**: Regular social interactions can help Adam build confidence and reduce social anxiety over time.
- **Improving Mental Health**: Social connections and a sense of belonging can positively impact Adam's mental health, helping to alleviate feelings of depression and isolation.
- **Reinforcing Positive Behaviors**: By consistently practicing good social etiquette, Adam can develop positive social habits that will benefit him in various aspects of his life.

In your book, this dynamic can illustrate how Adam's environment and the expectations of those around him contribute to his personal growth and social development.

# Accelerate Your Success

While you are here, my goal is to accelerate your path to success in the work place. And so I’m going to teach you some things that my dad taught me.

Listen, Adam. One of the reasons I brought you out here was because I believe you have a lot of potential. I am at a profession making good money. And I’m not smarter than you. The difference is that I had a dad that provided stability, and gave me tough love, and taught me the character traits I needed to tap into the abilities I had. Your dad was kind of absent, and I’m guessing he didn’t teach you the same things. And that’s why youve Been from place to place. What I want to do is teach you the things my dad taught me, so that you can springboard into a good career. The first lesson is this. When somebody walks into the room, you stop what you are doing, you get up, and you greet them. This is a sign of respect because you’re acknowledging them.

# Respond Quickly In Messenger

I don’t see how you have any excuse for going days without answering me in Messenger. Or weeks without mowing the lawn.

When you isolate yourself, people think you’re selfish and unaccountable to your time.

How many hours do you play XBOX?

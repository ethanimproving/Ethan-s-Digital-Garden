Bro, all throughout the Bible women were the downfall of great men.
- David's downfall was Bathsheba.
- Solomon's was his 700 wives that turned his heart away from the Lord.
- Samson gave the secret of his strength to Delilah.
- Ahab was led into idolatry by Jezebel.

You have the potential to become something great, and now is not the time to let yourself be distracted by women. Women are there to bring you peace, but right now you need war. You need to be in growth mode, not peace mode. Women are going to get in the way of you and a better life for yourself, and a better version of yourself. The women will come, but why choose one when you are the worst version of yourself? Wait until you become the man and you will attract a woman worthy of you.

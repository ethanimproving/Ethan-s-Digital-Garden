The discussion I had with Mariana resulted in the conclusion that in public, she agrees to follow my lead when I nudge her or indicate to her to do something (such as put her hand over her heart for the national anthem). If she has an issue with it, she will do it in the short term and challenge it in private after the fact. If she urgently disagrees with it, she can say, "Babe can I talk to you outside for a minute?"

I want to avoid airing out our arguments in public settings where we have to yell at each other in order to hear.

I will hear these words for a long time as she fought back tears. "I always thought one day you will think I'm not enough, all that you want religiously. But I am kind of shock." That sentence alone turned it around on me. I realized I made a mistake by making this a deal breaking issue. She wasn't trying to be rebellious and disrespectful. She just made a slip. It should have been a 5 minute conversation in the car the night before. But I let my thoughts feast on the preexisting notion I had that I am an inadequate leader.

She mocked me for a brief moment at Founder's Park. "What do you want me to say? You need me to make you feel like a man? You should be confident in who you are regardless of who follows you."

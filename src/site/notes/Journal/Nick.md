I invited Nick to come stay at my house while he is working on some IT certifications. Mariana doesn't like it because we won't get the opportunity to be alone together in the house, but I don't want to make big life decisions based on the lusts of the flesh. That's such a carnal reason to block this opportunity that the Lord is opening up for him and for me. With his help I can get my house done sooner. With Kenneth's help he can get into IT sooner. And all around I will be able to propose to Mariana sooner. So this is a good idea.

I understand why Mariana doesn't like it. It isn't because she wants a private place to have sex. It's because she's more comfortable being alone with me than being with me and other people. That is totally fair. But we will have all the time in the world for that when we're married.

The main idea I have in my mind for this decision is that I don't want to make big life decisions based on making provisions for the flesh. I would miss out on so much in life if my goal was to maximize pleasure. I would never want to do anything in public, or have family time, or invite people into my home because I would just stay at home all day and have sex with Mariana. That's not the life I want. There's more to life than that. And I need to be a person who minimizes opportunities for the flesh with the decisions I make. I want to be someone who acts out of faith in doing the right thing rather than someone who acts out of carnal desire to fuck Mariana.

Even though I care about Mariana and I value her input, I believe this is the right decision, so I remain unwavering in my decision.

I don't want to go to Ken's party today. Why? Because I feel like I should be working. I feel like there is a gravity pulling me to be productive today. I should be putting my time towards building something. Learning something. Or even just hiking a trail with Caleb, because then the conversation is meaningful. Party conversations are just for killing time.

Even during [[Goals/Timeline Events/Fun With Friends\|2021]], when we went to 6 Flags we were soul-winning. We were working something. We were accomplishing something. I have a hard time igniting the desire within myself to do things that I can't look back on and say, "I'm glad I spent my time doing that." I should be less selfish and realize that being there for my friend's birthday celebration *is* something I should look back on and be glad about. Why is celebration so devoid of purpose for you? Because there's no market value? There is value to the person being celebrated, surrounded by his friends, knowing they care. Live by principle.

Christ the Savior came from Heaven’s glory,
To redeem the lost from sin and shame;
On His brow he wore the thorn-crown glory,
And upon Calvary He took my blame.

*He lives on high, He lives on high,
Triumphant over sin and all its stain;
He lives on high, He lives on high,
Some day He’s coming again.*

He arose from death and all its sorrow,
To dwell in that land of joy and love;
He is coming back some glad tomorrow,
And He’ll take all His children home above. [Refrain]

Weary soul, to Jesus come confessing,
Redemption from sin He offers thee;
Look to Jesus and receive a blessing,
There is life, there is joy and victory! [Refrain]

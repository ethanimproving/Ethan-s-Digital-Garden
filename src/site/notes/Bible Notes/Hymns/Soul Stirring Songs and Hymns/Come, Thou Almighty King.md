Come, thou almighty King,
help us thy name to sing;
help us to praise.
Father all-glorious,
o'er all victorious,
come and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.

Come, thou incarnate Word,
gird on thy mighty sword;
our prayer attend.
Come and thy people bless,
and give thy Word success,
and let thy righteousness
on us descend.

Come, holy Comforter,
thy sacred witness bear
in this glad hour!
Thou, who almighty art,
now rule in ev'ry heart,
and ne'er from us depart,
Spirit of pow'r.

To thee, great One in Three,
eternal praises be
hence evermore!
Thy sov'reign majesty
may we in glory see,
and to eternity
love and adore.

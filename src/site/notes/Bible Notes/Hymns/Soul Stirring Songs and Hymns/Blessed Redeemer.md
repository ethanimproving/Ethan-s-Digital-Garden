Up Calv'ry's mountain one dreadful morn
Walked Christ, my Savior, weary and worn;
Facing for sinners death on the cross,
That He might save them from endless loss.

*Blessed Redeemer! Precious Redeemer!
Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree;
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading—
Blind and unheeding— dying for me!*

""Father, forgive them!"" thus did He pray,
E'en while His lifeblood flowed fast away;
Praying for sinners while in such woe–
No one but Jesus ever loved so. [Chorus]

O how I love Him, Savior and Friend,
How can my praises ever find end?
Thro' years unnumbered on heaven's shore,
My tongue shall praise Him forevermore. [Chorus]

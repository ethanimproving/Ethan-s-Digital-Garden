Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.
Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and he is on the throne.
It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,
and Jesus call to heaven's perfect peace.

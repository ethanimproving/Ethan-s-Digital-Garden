Wounded for me, wounded for me,
Wounded for me, He was wounded for me.
Gone my transgressions and now I am free,
All because Jesus was wounded for me.

Dying for me, dying for me,
Dying for me, He was dying for me.
Gone my transgressions and now I am free,
All because Jesus was dying for me.

Risen for me, risen for me,
Risen for me, He is risen for me.
Gone my transgressions and now I am free,
All because Jesus is risen for me.

Coming for me, coming for me,
Coming for me, He is coming for me.
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see;
Oh, how I praise Him, Heâ€™s coming for me.

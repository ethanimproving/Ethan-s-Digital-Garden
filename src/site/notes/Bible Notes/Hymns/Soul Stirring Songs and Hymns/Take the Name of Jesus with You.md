Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe.
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it then where'er you go.

*Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.*

Take the name of Jesus ever
As protection ev'rywhere.
If temptations 'round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer. [Refrain]

At the name of Jesus bowing,
When in heaven we shall meet,
King of kings, we'll gladly crown Him
When our journey is complete. [Refrain]

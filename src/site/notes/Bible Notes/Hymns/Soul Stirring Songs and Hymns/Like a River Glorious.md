Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace,
over all victorious in its bright increase:
perfect, yet still flowing fuller every day;
perfect, yet still growing deeper all the way.

*Trusting in the Father, hearts are fully blest,
finding, as he promised, perfect peace and rest.*

Hidden in the hollow of his mighty hand,
where no harm can follow, in his strength we stand.
We may trust him fully all for us to do;
those who trust him wholly find him wholly true. [Refrain]
Psalter Hymnal, 1987

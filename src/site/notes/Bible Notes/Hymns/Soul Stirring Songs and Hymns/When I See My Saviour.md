When I see my Savior, hanging on Calvary,
Bearing there for sinners bitterest agony,
Gratitude o’erwhelms me, makes mine eyes grow dim,
All my ransomed being captive is to Him.

I can see the blood-drops, red ’neath His thorny crown,
From the cruel nail wounds now they are falling down;
Lord, when I would wander from Thy love away,
Let me see those blood-drops shed for me that day.

“Why hast thou forsaken?”--list to that sad, sad moan!
Oh, His heart was broken, suffering there alone;
Broken then that mortals ne’er need cry in vain
For God’s love and comfort, in the hour of pain.

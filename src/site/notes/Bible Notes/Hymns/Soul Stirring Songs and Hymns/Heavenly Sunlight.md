Walking in sunlight, all of my journey,
over the mountains, through the deep vale;
Jesus has said, ""I’ll never forsake thee,""
promise divine that never can fail.

*Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight,
flooding my soul with glory divine:
hallelujah, I am rejoicing,
singing His praises, Jesus is mine.*

Shadows around me, shadows above me,
never conceal my Savior and Guide;
He is the light, in Him is no darkness;
ever I’m walking close to His side. [Refrain]

In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing,
pressing my way to mansions above;
singing His praises gladly I’m walking,
walking in sunlight, sunlight of love. [Refrain]

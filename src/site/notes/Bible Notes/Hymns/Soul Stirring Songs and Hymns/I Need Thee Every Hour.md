I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

*I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
Ev'ry hour I need Thee;
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee.*

I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their powâ€™r
When Thou art nigh. [Refrain]

I need Thee ev'ry hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain. [Refrain]

I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill. [Refrain]

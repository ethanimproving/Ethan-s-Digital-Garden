# Blueridge vs. Tosot

|                    |                              |                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Feature            | Tosot (Gree)                 | Blueridge (usually Midea or OEM) |
| Core components    | Very good (Gree compressors) | Varies (mostly Midea)            |
| Build quality      | Mid-to-high                  | Mid-range / budget               |
| Noise levels       | Generally quieter            | Can be slightly louder           |
| Warranty support   | Fairly strong                | Depends heavily on Alpine        |
| Parts availability | Good via Gree/Tosot          | Alpine is the main source        |
| Price point        | Slightly higher              | Lower cost                       |

Tosot is generally better quality than Blueridge.

If you plan to keep your system for 10+ years, Tosot is the better investment. Garage environments are tough. Temperature swings, dust, occasional moisture, all make durability important. Tosot’s Gree-built units are better sealed, use higher quality boards/components, and generally handle these conditions better.

# Reddit Insights

- Gree is China-based
- Blueridge units hold up fine
- Install a surge suppressor with all ductless systems.

YES — I strongly recommend you spend the extra ~$75 to protect your investment. It’s cheap insurance for your new Tosot unit.

# 120v vs. 230v

- 120V models typically only go up to 12k BTU (1 ton).
- 230V models are required for anything larger (18k, 24k, multi-zone, etc.)
- 230V gives you stronger compressor startup, less strain.

I would not personally jump into R-32 yet unless you’re buying from a brand with very strong U.S. R-32 support (Mitsubishi, Daikin, etc). Tosot and Blueridge are still 90% R-410A in their U.S. offerings right now anyway.

  
Amps ≠ energy consumption directly — they’re just a function of how much current is being drawn at the voltage level. What actually matters for electricity cost is total power (watts = volts × amps).

Let’s assume:
- You run the unit 8 hours/day, 90 days/year (common for a garage in Dallas)
- $0.14 per kWh electricity rate (Texas average)

|             |         |      |                 |             |
| ----------- | ------- | ---- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Model       | Voltage | Amps | Power Usage (W) | Annual Cost |
| 120V R-410A | 120V    | 10A  | 1,200 watts     | $121        |
| 230V R-32   | 230V    | 5A   | 1,150 watts     | $116        |

What about wear and tear in the unit?

At larger sizes (18k, 24k, 36k) this makes a real difference. But at 12k BTU: Startup loads are so small that even at 120V, wear-and-tear is very minimal. Proper surge protection completely offsets this concern.

Quantifiable difference in service life at 12k BTU? Probably less than 1–2% difference over 10–15 years of service life.

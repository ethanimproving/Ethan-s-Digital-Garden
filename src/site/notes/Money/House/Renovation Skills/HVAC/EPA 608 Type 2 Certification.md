To purchase R22 Freon and service your personal AC unit, you need to obtain an [EPA Section 608 Type II](https://www.epa.gov/section608/section-608-technician-certification-requirements) or Universal certification. These certifications allow you to handle high-pressure refrigerants, including R22. Type II Certification: Allows you to work on high-pressure systems such as residential air conditioning and heat pumps, which is all I need for personal use. Universal would be overkill, designed for all types of equipment, including low-pressure, high-pressure, and very high-pressure appliances. Type I certification only allows you to work on small appliances containing five pounds or less of refrigerant, such as window air conditioners, refrigerators, and freezers.

You do not have to take the Type I exam before you are eligible to take the Type II exam. The EPA Section 608 certification exams are designed to be independent of each other, and you can take the Type II exam directly without having completed the Type I exam. Each type of certification (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Universal) has its own specific focus and can be taken separately depending on your needs and the systems you plan to work on.

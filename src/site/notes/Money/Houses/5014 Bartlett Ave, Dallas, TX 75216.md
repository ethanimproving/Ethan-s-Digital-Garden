It seems to be in a [residential area](https://www.google.com/maps/place/5014+Bartlett+Ave,+Dallas,+TX+75216/@32.6868333,-96.7933622,1430m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x864e97a750d0ad8b:0x25446c5dfbfd8026!8m2!3d32.6862657!4d-96.7918751!16s%2Fg%2F11lqd7_lbw?entry=ttu) pretty close to shopping. It might be slightly **close to the road**, would have to visit to tell if the noise would be noticeable.

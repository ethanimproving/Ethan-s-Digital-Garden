The kingdom of Gwynedd emerged during the early medieval period, likely around the 5th century AD, as the Britons in the region sought to organize themselves in the face of increasing pressure from Anglo-Saxon invaders. It was founded by Cunedda, a legendary figure often associated with the migration of the Celtic Britons from the region of modern-day Scotland to Wales. Cunedda and his descendants established themselves as rulers in northwest Wales, laying the foundation for the kingdom of Gwynedd.

Over the centuries, Gwynedd grew in size and power, eventually becoming one of the most dominant kingdoms in Wales. Its rulers, such as Rhodri Mawr and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, sought to consolidate their authority and extend their influence over neighboring regions. Gwynedd reached its zenith under rulers like Llywelyn the Great, who successfully expanded its borders and asserted its independence in the face of English aggression.

Gwynedd played a pivotal role in the conflicts between the Welsh and English during the medieval period, often serving as a focal point for resistance against English domination. The kingdom experienced periods of stability and prosperity, as well as times of internal strife and external threats.

In times past my ancestors were Kings and warriors. They occupied their time protecting the Gwynedd kingdom from Viking attacks, and the threat of the Saxons. We are no longer needed for such endeavors. The threat of war is behind us, and strategic battle planning and fighting is a trait wasted on our bloodline. Instead of protecting 30,000 people from destruction, we will create cities and businesses. Our role is now to build rather than protect. The world at large keeps its countries accountable. Vikings would not be tolerated in any country. The US has emerged as the world power, and its forces would quickly obliterate such marauding groups. We recognized the opportunity of a better world when Lodowick Davis moved our bloodline from England into Maryland in 1736, soon to be independent from Great Britain.

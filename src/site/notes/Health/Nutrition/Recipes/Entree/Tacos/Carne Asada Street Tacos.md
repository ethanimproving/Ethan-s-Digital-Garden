-   **1** teaspoon chili powder
-   **1/2** teaspoon ground cumin

# Directions

1) In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.
2) Place the flank steak in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag, and pour the marinade over it. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.

4) Grill the steak for 6-8 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness.

-   **1** teaspoon chili powder
-   **1/2** teaspoon ground cumin

# Directions

1) In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.

3) Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the excess marinade.

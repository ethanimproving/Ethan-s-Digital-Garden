# Bacon Cheeseburger Pickle Poppers

## Ingredients

- Large dill pickles
- Ground beef
- BBQ seasoning (to taste)
- Shredded cheddar cheese
- Bacon slices
- BBQ sauce (optional for glazing)

## Directions

### Prep

1. Slice off the ends of the large dill pickles and cut them in half lengthwise.  
2. Use a spoon or knife to remove the seeds and membranes, creating pickle "boats."  
3. Cook the ground beef in a skillet, seasoning with BBQ rub seasoning for extra flavor. Set aside in a small bowl to cool slightly.  

### Cook

1. Stuff each pickle boat with the seasoned beef mixture and shredded cheddar cheese.  
2. Wrap each stuffed pickle with a slice of bacon, ensuring it is well-covered. Sprinkle extra seasoning on top of the bacon for an added kick.  
3. For a pellet grill: Preheat to 275°F, and place the bacon-wrapped pickles on the grill. Smoke for about 1 hour.  
4. Increase the temperature to 350°F and cook for another 10-15 minutes, until the bacon is crispy.  
5. For an air fryer: Set the temperature to 350°F and cook for 10-12 minutes until crispy.

### Eat

1. After cooking, brush the pickles with your favorite BBQ sauce and let it glaze for 5-10 minutes.  
2. Serve immediately, preferably with a side of ranch dressing for dipping.

These Bacon Cheeseburger Pickle Poppers make for a crispy, smoky, cheesy, and tangy appetizer that’s perfect for parties or as a snack. Store any leftovers in an airtight container and reheat in the air fryer for crispy results.

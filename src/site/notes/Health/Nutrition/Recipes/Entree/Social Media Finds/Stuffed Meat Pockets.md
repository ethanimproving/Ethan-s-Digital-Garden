# Ingredients

- 2 lbs of ground lamb  
- 4–5 pitas (cut in half)  
- 1 white onion (grated)  
- 1 tbsp mashed garlic  
- 1/2 bunch of chopped parsley  
- 1/2 tsp cumin  
- 1/2 tsp coriander powder  
- 1/2 tsp paprika  
- 1/2 tsp allspice  
- 1/2 tsp chili powder  
- Salt and pepper to taste  
- Labneh (for dip)  

# Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients with the ground lamb.  
2. Stuff the seasoned lamb into 4–5 pita halves.  
3. Grill or pan-fry until the bread is crispy and the lamb is cooked through, or reaches an internal temperature of 160°F.  
4. **Pro Tip**: If you're unsure whether the lamb is fully cooked, transfer the lamb-stuffed pitas to an oven-safe skillet and place it in a preheated oven at 300°F until it reaches your desired doneness.

[What's Going Around?](https://kesslerpediatrics.com/Resources/Medical-Library/What-s-Going-Around)

Friday morning after staying the night at Caleb's, I woke up with a dry throat. It feels irritated, and by Sunday I was coughing up green phlegm. My dad suggested it might be from staining the raised garden bed on July 4, which does appear plausible, but Faith, John Ball, and Tony all appear to have the same symptoms, so it may be something in the air.

On Thursday the 11th I finally woke-up without my throat feeling scratchy. I was sweaty in bed, and my scratchy throat was replaced with a tedious cough.

I woke up Friday the 
# Symptom

The patient reports experiencing a dry and scratchy throat, occasional green phlegm production, and difficulty breathing without wheezing. These symptoms have been present for three days, since July 5, and remain consistent. The patient does not have a fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, body aches, or headaches, but does experience slight nausea when coughing hard. The cough is primarily dry and most noticeable in the morning. The patient has a history of bronchial hypersensitivity following a COVID-19 infection, resulting in asthmatic symptoms managed with Breo, which has not been used for the past two months. The patient was exposed to an oil-based stain on July 4 while staining wood for a new raised garden. There are no changes in taste or smell, and no ear or sinus pain. The patient also inhaled VBM guard, which helped mitigate the urge to cough. The patient is allergic to ragweed.

# Diagnosis

Based on your symptoms and history, it appears that your respiratory issues could be related to a combination of factors, including possible environmental irritants from the oil-based stain and your underlying bronchial hypersensitivity. Given that you are producing green phlegm, it suggests there might be a bacterial component, which can sometimes follow a viral infection or exposure to an irritant.

Here are some steps and considerations that might help manage your symptoms:

### Immediate Actions

1. **Avoid Further Exposure**:
    - Stay away from any further exposure to the oil-based stain or other potential irritants.

2. **Resume Breo**:
    - Consider resuming your Breo inhaler, as it can help manage asthma-like symptoms and reduce inflammation in your airways.

3. **Hydration**:
    - Drink plenty of fluids to keep your throat moist and help thin out mucus.

4. **Steam Inhalation**:
    - Use a humidifier or take steamy showers to help ease breathing and loosen mucus.

5. **Over-the-Counter Medications**:
    - Use over-the-counter expectorants (like **guaifenesin**) to help loosen mucus and make it easier to cough up.
    - Consider using **saline nasal sprays** or rinses to keep your nasal passages clear, even if you're not congested.

6. **Rest**:
    - Ensure you get plenty of rest to help your body recover.

### When to Seek Medical Attention

- If your breathing difficulty worsens.
- If you develop a high fever.
- If you experience chest pain or severe discomfort.
- If the green phlegm persists or increases, as this may indicate a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.
- If you notice any other concerning symptoms.

### Long-term Management

- **Asthma Control**: Since you mentioned bronchial hypersensitivity, keeping your asthma under control with your prescribed inhaler (Breo) is crucial.
- **Allergen Avoidance**: Be mindful of ragweed season and take appropriate steps to minimize exposure and manage allergy symptoms.
- **Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider can help manage and monitor your respiratory health.

It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional, especially given your history of bronchial hypersensitivity and the potential for complications. They can provide a thorough evaluation and prescribe appropriate treatments, such as antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected.

# Possible Conditions

## Bronchiolitis (and RSV)

We are currently seeing cases of bronchiolitis, a viral illness (sometimes caused by RSV -- "respiratory syncytial virus") that occurs most often in children under age 2. This virus typically occurs in epidemics during the winter and the early spring. **"Bronchioles" are the smallest airways in our lungs, and "itis" means these airways are inflamed**, or irritated, by the virus. When these airways get inflamed in young children, they often will start to "wheeze," meaning air and the oxygen in it have difficulty getting through these narrowed, swollen airways.

With a case of bronchiolitis, your infant's symptoms may begin with a runny nose, a fever, and a harsh, tight cough. If it progresses to wheezing, your child may start to breathe rapidly and "pull" with his/her abdomen and rib muscles with each breath. Please call us for an appointment if your child's breathing becomes labored or difficult.

Beyfortus is a monoclonal antibody with activity against RSV. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. One dose of Beyfortus, administered as a single intramuscular injection prior to or during RSV season, may provide protection during the RSV season.

## Colds and Upper Respiratory Infections

Colds, upper respiratory infections, and URIs are common terms we use to describe viral illnesses that cause nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, fever, and cough. The fever usually lasts for 2-3 days, and the cough with congestion and runny nose may last for 5-10 days. The typical preschool-age child may experience 6-10 colds per year. Most colds resolve on their own with rest and fluids, but some may lead to ear infection, sinus infection, asthma attack, or other complications. If you are concerned about the possibility of one of these complications, please have your child seen in our office for an evaluation.

## Croup

We are currently seeing cases of croup, a viral respiratory illness that most often is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The cough and breathing that are associated with croup make it distinctly different from other viral colds or respiratory illnesses. This is because the parainfluenza virus infects and irritates the voice box, the vocal cords, and the windpipe. The cough is worse at night, and it has a distinct bark that sounds much like a seal's bark. Associated with the barky cough, your child may have difficulty when inhaling air, making a labored and whistling sound when breathing in -- called stridor. Humidified air and fluids often are the most helpful treatments.Please call the office to have your child evaluated by the doctor if he/she has symptoms of croup.

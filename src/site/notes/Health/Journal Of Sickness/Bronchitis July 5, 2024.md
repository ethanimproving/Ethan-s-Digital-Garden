[What's Going Around?](https://kesslerpediatrics.com/Resources/Medical-Library/What-s-Going-Around)

Friday morning after staying the night at Caleb's, I woke up with a dry throat. It feels irritated, and by Sunday I was coughing up green phlegm. My dad suggested it might be from staining the raised garden bed on July 4, which does appear plausible, but Faith, John Ball, and Tony all appear to have the same symptoms, so it may be something in the air.

On Thursday the 11th I finally woke-up without my throat feeling scratchy. I was sweaty in bed, and my scratchy throat was replaced with a tedious cough.

Monday the 15th I woke up very sweaty, and my room stank horribly. My right first rib felt a sharp pain and appeared red on the skin. Abs had previously hurt from all the coughing, but this was something new. It felt easier to talk, and Mariana convinced me to make a doctor appointment, so I made a Doctor on Demand appointment.

# Symptom

The patient reports experiencing a dry and scratchy throat, occasional green phlegm production, and difficulty breathing without wheezing. These symptoms have been present for three days, since July 5, and remain consistent. The patient does not have a fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, body aches, or headaches, but does experience slight nausea when coughing hard. The cough is primarily dry and most noticeable in the morning. The patient has a history of bronchial hypersensitivity following a COVID-19 infection, resulting in asthmatic symptoms managed with Breo, which has not been used for the past two months. The patient was exposed to an oil-based stain on July 4 while staining wood for a new raised garden. There are no changes in taste or smell, and no ear or sinus pain. The patient also inhaled VBM guard, which helped mitigate the urge to cough. The patient is allergic to ragweed.

# Diagnosis

Based on your symptoms and history, it appears that your respiratory issues could be related to a combination of factors, including possible environmental irritants from the oil-based stain and your underlying bronchial hypersensitivity. Given that you are producing green phlegm, it suggests there might be a bacterial component, which can sometimes follow a viral infection or exposure to an irritant.

Here are some steps and considerations that might help manage your symptoms:

### Immediate Actions

1. **Avoid Further Exposure**:
    - Stay away from any further exposure to the oil-based stain or other potential irritants.

2. **Resume Breo**:
    - Consider resuming your Breo inhaler, as it can help manage asthma-like symptoms and reduce inflammation in your airways.

3. **Hydration**:
    - Drink plenty of fluids to keep your throat moist and help thin out mucus.

4. **Steam Inhalation**:
    - Use a humidifier or take steamy showers to help ease breathing and loosen mucus.

5. **Over-the-Counter Medications**:
    - Use over-the-counter expectorants (like **guaifenesin**) to help loosen mucus and make it easier to cough up.
    - Consider using **saline nasal sprays** or rinses to keep your nasal passages clear, even if you're not congested.

6. **Rest**:
    - Ensure you get plenty of rest to help your body recover.

### When to Seek Medical Attention

- If your breathing difficulty worsens.
- If you develop a high fever.
- If you experience chest pain or severe discomfort.
- If the green phlegm persists or increases, as this may indicate a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.
- If you notice any other concerning symptoms.

### Long-term Management

- **Asthma Control**: Since you mentioned bronchial hypersensitivity, keeping your asthma under control with your prescribed inhaler (Breo) is crucial.
- **Allergen Avoidance**: Be mindful of ragweed season and take appropriate steps to minimize exposure and manage allergy symptoms.
- **Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider can help manage and monitor your respiratory health.

It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional, especially given your history of bronchial hypersensitivity and the potential for complications. They can provide a thorough evaluation and prescribe appropriate treatments, such as antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected.

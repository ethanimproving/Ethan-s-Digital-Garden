Vitamin C is known for its role in supporting the immune system and acting as an antioxidant. Here's how it might alleviate a chronic cough:

1. **Immune Support**: Vitamin C boosts the immune system, helping your body fight off infections and inflammation that could be contributing to a chronic cough.
    
2. **Antioxidant Properties**: As an antioxidant, vitamin C helps reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Chronic cough can sometimes be associated with inflammation in the respiratory tract, and reducing this inflammation can alleviate the symptoms.
    
3. **Collagen Production**: Vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen, which helps maintain the integrity of tissues, including those in the respiratory tract. Healthier tissues can be more resistant to irritants that might cause coughing.
    
4. **Histamine Reduction**: Vitamin C can help reduce histamine levels in the body. Histamines can cause symptoms like coughing, sneezing, and runny nose. By lowering histamine levels, vitamin C might help reduce these symptoms.
    

The initial high doses of vitamin C could provide a significant boost to your immune system and reduce inflammation quickly, which helps in alleviating the chronic cough. The maintenance dose helps keep your immune system strong and prevents the cough from returning.

# 3 Main Determinants for Procrastination

2. Rewards/punishments
3. **Time pressure**

Time pressure is the main factor in addressing Parkinson's Law.[^2]

When you take a test before running a marathon, your body perceives it as physical exhaustion. This is also the case for the opposite results. When you run a marathon before taking a test, your mind is too tired to exert effort.[^1]

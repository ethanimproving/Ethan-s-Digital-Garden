# Theo/Jeanne Miller ♦ Brian Dewberry
*(January 30, 2012)*

In keeping with our—Theo and Jeanne Miller—joint desire to help Brian Dewberry become more intentional about finding and keeping a job, more personal in building relationships, more focused in both individual and corporate worship, and more motivated to find his life purpose, we set forth these **RULES** for Brian to follow in order to remain in our home as he works to write the next chapter for his life. We realize that the economic climate today makes finding a self-supporting job difficult, but unless Brian is willing to try harder to develop and achieve some personally-motivated and self-implemented goals, we cannot allow him to continue living in our home. Thus, he must agree to follow all of these **RULES** or accept the consequences, which include a revocation of permission to remain in our home.

In realization that without setting and pursuing personal goals, I’ll never be able to achieve them, I—Brian Dewberry—agree to make all necessary adjustments in habits, behaviors, and decision-making to meet the **RULES** of Theo and Jeanne Miller laid out in this contract. I recognize and appreciate the tremendous sacrifices they have made to provide food and shelter, and I will show that appreciation by becoming more intentional about setting vocational goals, making personal progress, and achieving financial independence. The Miller family has been beyond generous in what they have provided, and I intend to show my appreciation by following each and every one of these **RULES**, recognizing that failure to do so means that I’ll be forced to leave.

From this point forward, I—Brian Dewberry—agree to fulfill the following expectations:

1. When at home, I will eat together with the family at meal-times rather than eating my food alone so that I can work on building better relationships with those around me.
2. I will adjust my sleep-cycle so that I sleep at night and stay awake during the day. By not staying up into the early morning hours on the computer, reading, or playing video games, I am more likely to adjust well to normal employment hours. So, I will change my schedule to be in bed by 11 p.m. and agree to wake up every day (except Saturday) by 8:00 a.m.
3. I agree to meet with Steve Chappell, my accountability partner, every week at a mutually agreed upon time—traveling to his office in order to respect his time schedule.
   - I agree to answer all questions that he asks when we meet
   - I agree to implement any behavioral changes that Steve suggests
   - I recognize my need for direction and will look to those who care enough for me to provide it—including both the Miller family, my pastor, and Steve Chappell
4. I will attend Sunday morning worship services at Northlake Baptist Church every week, unless sickness or employment prevents me from doing so:
   - I will attend Sunday school and participate in the study/discussion
   - I will interact with people at church to deepen relationships and learn how to better connect with people in a positive environment
5. I will renew my commitment to having a daily quiet time, spending some time each day in the Word and in prayer, seeking God’s direction for life.
6. I will make plans to leave the Miller home 6 weeks from today—our agreed upon target date of March 12, 2012—motivating me to move forward and write the next chapter of life.

# Squatter's Rights

In Texas, the concept of squatter's rights falls under adverse possession laws, which generally apply to individuals who occupy a property openly and continuously for a specific period, usually without the owner's permission. Here's what you need to know regarding your situation:

### Adverse Possession in Texas

- **Time Requirement**: To claim adverse possession, a squatter typically needs to occupy the property for a continuous period, which can range from 3 to 10 years depending on the circumstances and the specific claim (with 10 years being the most common period).
- **Open and Notorious**: The occupancy must be obvious to anyone, including the property owner, and the squatter must act as if they are the owner.
- **Hostile**: The occupation must be without the owner’s permission.

### Tenant vs. Squatter

- **Tenant Relationship**: If your friend initially moved in with your permission, even if not paying rent, this situation is more akin to a landlord-tenant relationship rather than adverse possession.
- **No Formal Lease**: Without a formal lease, he could be considered a month-to-month tenant.

### Eviction Process

1. **Notice to Vacate**: You must provide a written notice to vacate. For tenants without a lease, Texas law typically requires a 30-day notice, but in some cases, it could be shorter.
2. **File for Eviction**: If your friend does not leave by the end of the notice period, you must file an eviction lawsuit (forcible detainer suit) in the appropriate justice of the peace court.
3. **Court Hearing**: Attend the court hearing to present your case. If the court rules in your favor, your friend will be given a specific period to vacate.
4. **Writ of Possession**: If your friend still does not leave, you can obtain a writ of possession from the court, which authorizes law enforcement to remove them from the property.

### Key Points

- **Document Everything**: Keep records of all communications and any written agreements or notices given.
- **Avoid Self-Help Evictions**: Do not attempt to remove your friend or their belongings without going through the legal eviction process, as this can lead to legal repercussions for you.
- **Legal Advice**: Consult with a local attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law to ensure you follow all legal procedures correctly.

In summary, while your friend is unlikely to successfully claim squatter’s rights if they have only been living with you for a short period and with your permission, you must follow the proper legal eviction process to remove them from your home.

# Stupid Law Origin

The concept of adverse possession, often perceived as "squatter's rights," may seem counterintuitive, but it has historical and practical roots. Here's an overview of why adverse possession laws were established and their rationale:

### Historical Origins

1. **Medieval England**: Adverse possession laws trace back to medieval England, where they aimed to encourage the productive use of land. If land was left unattended and someone else put it to use, the law favored the productive user after a certain period.
2. **Common Law Principles**: These laws were incorporated into common law, which many countries, including the United States, adopted.

### Rationale Behind Adverse Possession

1. **Encouraging Land Use**: The primary purpose is to ensure land is used efficiently and productively. If land is abandoned or neglected, adverse possession incentivizes others to take responsibility for it.
2. **Clear Title and Ownership**: Over time, adverse possession helps resolve disputes and clarify land ownership. If someone occupies land openly and the original owner does not contest it, the law recognizes the occupier as the rightful owner to prevent long-standing disputes.
3. **Economic Development**: By encouraging the use of unused land, adverse possession can contribute to economic development and community improvement.
4. **Protection Against Neglect**: The laws protect communities from the negative impacts of neglected or abandoned properties, which can become eyesores, safety hazards, or hubs for criminal activity.

### Conditions and Limitations

1. **Strict Criteria**: Adverse possession laws require strict criteria to be met, including continuous and open occupation for a significant period, often ranging from 3 to 30 years, depending on the jurisdiction.
2. **Legal Process**: Claiming adverse possession is not straightforward; it often involves legal proceedings to prove that all conditions have been met.
3. **Owner's Rights**: Property owners can prevent adverse possession by regularly inspecting their property, addressing encroachments promptly, and asserting their ownership rights.

### Modern Context

1. **Balancing Interests**: Modern adverse possession laws balance the interests of property owners and those who put neglected land to productive use.
2. **Urban and Rural Areas**: These laws apply to both urban and rural areas, addressing different types of land use and occupation scenarios.

### Conclusion

Adverse possession laws may seem unfair or "stupid" at first glance, but they have a historical basis and practical rationale. They encourage the productive use of land, help resolve ownership disputes, and protect communities from the negative impacts of neglected properties. These laws aim to balance the rights of property owners with the need for efficient land use and economic development.

# Qualifications

If you are actively using your property, adverse possession laws would not apply to someone living there with your permission, even if they refuse to work or contribute. Adverse possession is designed for situations where a property owner has abandoned or neglected the property, and someone else takes over its use without permission. Here’s how your situation fits into the context of adverse possession:

### Key Elements of Adverse Possession

1. **Continuous and Uninterrupted Use**: The person claiming adverse possession must occupy the property continuously and without interruption for a statutory period (typically 3 to 10 years in Texas).
2. **Open and Notorious Use**: The occupation must be obvious to the property owner and the public. The possessor acts as if they are the owner.
3. **Hostile Use**: The occupation must be without the permission of the property owner.
4. **Exclusive Use**: The possessor must be the only one using the property.

### Your Situation

1. **Permission Given**: Your friend initially moved in with your permission. This means the use of the property is not "hostile" in the legal sense required for adverse possession.
2. **Active Use by Owner**: You are actively using or maintaining the property, which means it is not abandoned or neglected.
3. **Short-Term Occupancy**: Even if your friend has been living in your house for a while, the time period is likely far shorter than the statutory period required for adverse possession.

### Legal Standing

Since you are actively using the property and your friend moved in with your permission, adverse possession does not apply. Instead, the situation is more akin to a landlord-tenant relationship. Here’s how to address it:

### Eviction Process in Texas

1. **Provide Written Notice**: Issue a written notice to vacate, typically giving 30 days if there is no formal lease agreement.
2. **File for Eviction**: If your friend does not leave by the end of the notice period, you must file an eviction lawsuit (forcible detainer suit) in the appropriate justice of the peace court.
3. **Attend the Hearing**: Present your case in court. If the court rules in your favor, your friend will be given a specific period to vacate.
4. **Enforce the Ruling**: If your friend still does not leave, obtain a writ of possession from the court, allowing law enforcement to remove them from the property.

### Practical Steps

- **Document Everything**: Keep records of all communications, notices, and any agreements.
- **Legal Advice**: Consult with a local attorney specializing in landlord-tenant law to ensure you follow all legal procedures correctly.
- **Avoid Self-Help Evictions**: Do not attempt to remove your friend or their belongings without going through the legal eviction process.

By following the proper legal steps, you can address the situation without your friend being able to claim squatter's rights or adverse possession.

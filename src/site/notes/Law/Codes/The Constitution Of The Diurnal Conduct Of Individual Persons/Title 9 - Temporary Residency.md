# Article 1: House Rules for Temporary Residents

## § 1. Smoking

**1.1** Wash clothes every day to prevent smoke particles from carrying the smoke smell into the house.

**1.2** Smoke at least 20 feet from the house to minimize the infiltration of smoke into window sills and door cracks.

**1.3** Dispose of all smoke joints outside; bringing them inside can pollute the house.

**1.4** Vaping must be done outside as well. The odor is less than smoking, but it can still linger and affect indoor air quality.

**1.5** Purchase [fan-attached carbon filters](https://www.amazon.com/CarbonPur-Activated-Pollutants-Long-Lasting-Performance/dp/B0CP7PLDC9/ref=asc_df_B0CP7PLDC9/) every 3 months to reduce indoor smoke odor and particles.

There is a path you can take to make your life end up fantastic, but it requires accountability.

> 7. For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
> 8. Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
> 9. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
> 10. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that **if any would not work, neither should he eat**.
> 11. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
> 12. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

## § 4. Regular Check-ins

**4.1** Temporary resident agrees to engage in regular check-ins (weekly or at the discretion of House Owner) to discuss any issues or updates.

# Article 3: Skill Development for Temporary Residents

I want to offer my home as a temporary launching pad to kick start people’s careers. A big problem in the world is the lack of time to focus on developing higher paying skills. My dad afforded me a year of studying code, completely taking care of everything I needed while I was grinding every day until I landed a job as a programmer. It was a risk. He took a chance on me. He could have told me to get any job out there and I never would have reached my potential because I would have been too preoccupied with being a CADD technician. The problem with high school is that people don’t know what they want to do. When we’re old enough and wise enough that we’ve finally answered that question, we no longer have enough breathing space to achieve it. I want to help by provided to people what my dad provided to me: time to learn. Time to study and grow while you’re not preoccupied with your job. So I can provide my house, utilities, groceries, and my life ends up having sacrificed almost nothing to help kickstart your career, increasing the value of your labor hour.

Somebody might be trying to increase the value of their labor hour by taking courses online to learn a skill that will pay more. I am totally fine with a person not having a job if they are engaged in such an activity. The world is full of untapped potential due to people being too preoccupied with the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy; if a few months of dependence is what it takes to kickstart a higher paying career, my home is welcome to be a launching pad for said efforts, contingent upon the below stipulations: 

## § 1. Educational Pursuits

**1.1** Residents focusing on skill development must demonstrate progress or completion of online courses or relevant educational activities.

**1.2** Any non-job-seeking period is limited to a maximum of 6 months without substantial progress in skill development, after which employment efforts must resume.

# Article 4: Spiritual and Personal Responsibilities

## § 1. Duty: Come To Church

**1.1** [[Journal/Adam/Duty#Come To Church\|Attend church]] every Sunday to commemorate the resurrection and foster spiritual growth among fellow believers.

## § 2. Accountability and Planning

**2.1** Develop a clear plan for personal and professional growth to accelerate independence and career advancement.

# Article 5: Personal Conduct and Responsibilities

## § 1. Productive Use of Time

**1.1** Refrain from playing XBOX to prioritize productive activities over leisure, fostering personal development and readiness for employment opportunities.

## § 2. Managing Anxiety and Personal Presentation

**2.1** Address anxiety and [[Goals/Ethan's Commitments#I am socially dexterous\|present oneself confidently]] rather than avoiding social interaction, emphasizing personal growth and effective communication skills.

## § 3. Etiquette and Respect

**3.1** Acknowledge the presence of visitors and engage in courteous greetings when entering shared spaces, reflecting respect and hospitality. Do not isolate yourself in your room, but make a point to greet your housemates at least daily when they are present. Be willing to pause your current activities or phone conversations to acknowledge others.

> [!bible] [Leviticus 19:32 - KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+19:32&version=kjv)
> 32. Thou shalt **rise up before the hoary head**, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

This verse indicates that rising up before a person of age is a show of respect. Endeavor to respect your housemates in the same way.

**3.2** Ensure a prompt response to messages and fulfill agreed-upon tasks promptly, demonstrating accountability and reliability.

# Article 6: Sexual Conduct and Spiritual Guidance

## § 1. Sexual Purity and Accountability

**1.1** Abstain from [[Journal/Adam/Fornication In The House\|engaging in fornication]] to uphold biblical teachings and maintain spiritual purity within the household.

**1.2** Maintain discretion in personal conduct to avoid jeopardizing relationships and spiritual standing within the church community.

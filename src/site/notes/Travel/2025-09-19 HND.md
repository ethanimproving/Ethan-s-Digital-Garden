## Is the Japan Rail Pass still the best and cheapest option?

- The¬†**Japan Rail Pass**¬†(around $325 for 7 days, $521 for 14 days) can cover the major long-distance travel days:
    
    - Tokyo-Kyoto (Sep 24)
        
    - Kyoto-Osaka local train (Sep 25)
        
    - Osaka-Tokyo (Sep 27)
        
    - Plus other JR train rides within Tokyo and local travel to Disneyland/DisneySea.
        
- The intense cost of shinkansen rides alone ($182 combined for Tokyo-Kyoto and Osaka-Tokyo) makes the pass potentially cost-effective if you use those days.
    
- For non-JR transport (Kawaguchiko bus and Hakone local transport), separate ticket purchases (about $78 combined) are required.
    
- If you only take long-distance shinkansen rides and some JR local trains, the¬†**Japan Rail Pass likely offers good value and convenience**¬†over individual tickets, especially if intending to book reserved seats.
    
- If you plan only limited travel beyond Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka, buying individual tickets might save money, but for this itinerary JR Pass is recommended.
    

Overall, the¬†**JR Pass remains the best and most convenient option**¬†for high-frequency shinkansen travel and JR lines in your itinerary despite the upfront cost, especially given the value of seat reservations and ease of travel.

## Shinkansen Tokyo ‚Üí Kyoto

The¬†**best way to get from Tokyo to Kyoto as a visitor from the US is by riding the Shinkansen (bullet train)**, specifically the Tokaido Shinkansen, which is fast, easy to use, and runs frequently between Tokyo Station and Kyoto Station.

Key steps for your journey:

- **Depart from Tokyo Station**¬†(or Shinagawa Station for easier airport connections)
    
- **Arrive at Kyoto Station**, where you'll find seamless access to local transport, shops, and hotels.
    
- Purchase tickets online (SmartEX, Klook), at ticket machines, or at JR Ticket Offices; English support is available.[](https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/tokyo-to-kyoto-and-osaka)
    

**Recommended Shinkansen types:**

- **Nozomi**: Fastest (~2hr 15m) but¬†_not_¬†covered by the Japan Rail Pass.
    
- **Hikari**: Next fastest (~2hr 30m), covered by the¬†**Japan Rail Pass**¬†(best value for round-trip and multi-city travel).
    

If traveling with large luggage (over 160cm linear size),¬†_free seat reservation for oversized bags is required_.[](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2018.html)

**Further details for US travelers:**

- **Japan Rail Pass**¬†is highly recommended if you plan to travel beyond Tokyo-Kyoto (Osaka, Hiroshima, etc.) and can be purchased online before arrival; use it on Hikari and Kodama trains.
    
- **Single tickets**¬†are available for Nozomi, Hikari, or Kodama trains‚Äîpurchase at the station, ticket machines, or online. Nozomi is fastest, but Japan Rail Pass does¬†_not_¬†cover it.
    
- **Booking**: Platforms like SmartEX or Klook accept foreign credit cards, and tickets can be collected at stations.[](https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/onlinebooking/contents/kyoto/)
    
- **Luggage**: Up to two pieces allowed per person under 160cm each; for 161‚Äì250cm, reserve a seat space when booking or at the ticket office.[](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2018.html)
    
- **Departure frequency**: Trains leave every 10‚Äì15 minutes throughout the day.
